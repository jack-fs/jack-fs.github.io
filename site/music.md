I am a Spooky man in the [Spooky Men's Chorale](https://www.spookymen.com), 
and help out with some other choirs including [Sydney Alterna Choir](ht tps://www.instagram.com/sydneyalternachoir/) and, during 2020 helped teach [Massive Singlet](https://massivesinglet.com), the enormous online Zoom choir run by Stephen Taberner.

I am also a member of the tiny acoustic outfit the [Sofa of Fools](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sofaoffools "coming soon to a lounge room near you").
